# nyc-movement-data

Early in the pandemic, when the situation was dire in NYC, I began wondering if data could show inequality in who was able to leave the city and who stayed. These are some of the scripts I wrote to analyze movement data from SafeGraph and census data on income to see if there was a correlation between income and leaving NYC. 

Some of the results are represented in the images folder (darker blue = lower median income; darker red = more people left the city).
